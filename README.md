## Build Notes

### Files
Dockerfile is used for creating a docker image and is annotated.

Django can run a local server with manage.py runserver and will also serve
local static files, this is useful for development, but should not be used
in production. It is commented out if you wish to use it locally.

manage.py is used to manage and run the Django application
```
python3 manage.py
```
**Directory**
* whyness_django - The Django application;
* templates - Templates used to render the application;
* static - Static image and javascript files used by the application,
during development they can be served by manage.py runserver, but should
be served separately in production.

To reduce the effort to maintain this app, only Django version 3.2 is supported, others
may work, YMMV.

Apache is preferred to serve the application in production,
it is also used for serving static files including javascript, css and images.

### Docker commands

Two build scripts are available, build.sh for building and uploading the main docker image
and build-runner.sh for building and running the queue runner

### Build an image
```
cd ~/whyness_django
sudo docker build --tag whyness_django .
```

on Macbooks:
```
sudo docker buildx build . --platform=linux/amd64 -t whyness_django .
```

### Create a container

If you don't name the container, docker will generate a random one for you.

The Following environment variables must be set:

* BUILD_CONFIG	PROD/DEV
* AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
* AWS_REGION_NAME
* DJANGO_SECRET_KEY
* EMAIL_HOST
* EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD
* EMAIL_HOST_USER
* EMAIL_PORT
* RDS_DB_NAME
* RDS_HOSTNAME
* RDS_PASSWORD (optional - if not set it will try to get it for the environment from Parameter store)
* RDS_PORT
* RDS_USERNAME

The environment variables may be set in a file and passed in during the container start. Example:

Create environment variables file:
```
touch env.list
```

Fill in the file with content as above:
```
BUILD_CONFIG=
EMAIL_HOST=
RDS_DB_NAME=
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY = "REMOVED"
etc
```

Create docker container with environment files
```
sudo docker container create -p 8000:8000 --name whyness_django --env-file env.list whyness_django
```

### AWS Configuration 

The application uses the `boto3` python library and therefore uses the credential initialisation patterns from boto. See docs here:

This can be via the config files of the AWS CLI which boto loads automatically and other methods including setting the following environment variables:

* AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
* AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

For docker configuration the credentials on the host system are mounted, in AWS the IAM role for the service running the application is used.


### List all containers
```
sudo docker ps -a
```

### Start and stop a container
```
sudo docker container start [CONTAINER ID]
sudo docker container stop [CONTAINER ID]

# docker run can be used to create and start a container
sudo docker container run -p 8000:8000 --name whyness_django --env-file env.list -v $HOME/.aws/credentials:/home/app/.aws/credentials:ro whyness_django

```

### Connect
Connect to the Django website using your favourite browser
```
http://IP.REMOVED:8000/
```

## Notes

List all docker images:
```
$ sudo docker image ls -a
```

List all docker containers:
```
$ sudo docker container ls -a
```

Information about a container including the location of container files
```
sudo docker container inspect [CONTAINER ID]
```

It's important to remove images and containers that are no longer required.
If an image fails to build it's important to remove the failed build, they
can be identified with <none> in the repository and tag for example:
```
$ sudo docker image ls -a
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
<none>       <none>    c5c63f978c91   45 hours ago   948MB
```

To remove image c5c63f978c91:
```
sudo docker rmi 2d886365108e
```

To see a list of containers that may prevent deleting an image
```
$ sudo docker container ls -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS                       PORTS     NAMES
68bca922bc72   59976f711c0c   "/bin/sh -c 'pip insâ€¦"   45 hours ago    Exited (127) 45 hours ago              eager_chatelet
```

To remove container 68bca922bc72:
```
sudo docker rm 68bca922bc72
```
Connecting to AWS services such as S3, Transcribe, requires setting the environment variables
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

env.sh extracts aws credentials and shows how to set them.

Parse amazon credentials file:
```
./env.sh path/to/name.csv
```


## DEPLOYMENT TO AWS

- Deployed using App runner service
- Two services need to be running - Main App (core API and services), and the Queue Runner (Periodically checks for new audio files to transcribe and status of transcriptions). The queue runner needs to be optimised and improved.
- Environment variables need to be setup in the configuration, however AWS uses service roles for accessing other resources
- Stack was deployed manually so infrastructure as code templates are not available. However the stack uses only 3-4 key services in addition to IAM
